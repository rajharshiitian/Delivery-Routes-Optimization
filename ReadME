This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on optimizing delivery routes, developed as part of the ME312 course on Operations Research and Optimization Techniques. The project aims to minimize the total distance and time required for delivering goods to multiple locations, leveraging Python and its powerful libraries.

Project Overview
Efficiently planning delivery routes is critical for reducing operational costs and improving customer satisfaction in logistics and supply chain management. This project addresses the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), where the goal is to determine the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles delivering to a set of locations. The solution optimizes the routes to minimize travel distance, time, and overall delivery costs while considering constraints such as vehicle capacity and delivery time windows.

Key Features
Problem Formulation: Modeled the delivery routing problem as a VRP, taking into account various constraints like vehicle capacities, delivery deadlines, and depot locations.
Data Input: Used synthetic or real-world data for the locations of delivery points, including coordinates, demand, and time windows. Preprocessed this data to fit the optimization model.
Optimization Algorithms: Implemented various optimization techniques, such as:
Greedy Algorithms: A simple approach to quickly generate initial feasible solutions.
Genetic Algorithms: An evolutionary approach to explore a wider solution space and find near-optimal solutions.
Simulated Annealing: A probabilistic technique to escape local optima and converge to a global optimum.
Linear Programming: Used for solving smaller instances of the problem with exact methods.
Visualization: Plotted the optimized delivery routes on a map using libraries like Matplotlib and Folium to visually analyze the efficiency of the routes.
Performance Evaluation: Compared the performance of different algorithms in terms of total distance traveled, computational time, and solution quality.
Results
The project successfully demonstrated the ability to optimize delivery routes, achieving significant reductions in travel distance and time compared to unoptimized routes. The use of advanced algorithms allowed for the consideration of multiple constraints, resulting in practical and efficient routing solutions.

Future Work
Extending the model to handle more complex real-world constraints, such as dynamic traffic conditions and varying vehicle speeds.
Integrating machine learning techniques to predict delivery times more accurately and further refine route optimization.
Developing a user-friendly interface or dashboard to allow non-technical users to input delivery data and generate optimized routes easily.
